\begin{enumerate}
	\item  Information was found for the energy of different accelerators using information
	found on wikipedia. This information was compiled into a list and used to make livingston plots
	for how the center of mass energy changes over time.\\

		grouped by the type of accelerator.}

	The same data was used to make a plot for newer detectors from the 1990's up to some future proposed detectors.

	\item Information on the luminosity was also found and placed into another plot.
